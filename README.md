# Droplet
A prototype EmberCLI web app for tracking blood glucose levels.

## Built on Ember CLI with a Rails backend
This is my first Ember project. It has turned out to be quite a bit more difficult to get my head around than AngularJS.

Should have it deployed to Heroku sometime in the next week or so
